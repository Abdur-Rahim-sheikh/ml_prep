### How to overcome underfitting?
1) Increase Model Complexity
    - Use more complex model architectures that can capture the underlying patterns in the data more effectively.
2) Feature Engineering
    - Enhance the model input with additional features or transform existing features to improve model learning capacity.
3) Reduce Regularization
    - If regularization is applied, reducing its strength can allow the model to fit the training data more closely.
4) More Training Data
    - Increasing the amount of training data can help the model to learn the underlying patterns more effectively.

also...
- Reduce Dropout
- Increase the number of layers and neurons in the neural network. (which is increasing the model complexity)
- Increase the number of epochs

### How to overcome overfitting?
1) Simplify Model
    - Use a less complex model to prevent the model from capturing noise in the training data.
2) Cross-Validation
    - Use cross-validation techniques to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.
3) Regularization Techniques
    - Apply regularization methods (like L1, L2 regularization) to penalize large weights and prevent the model from fitting the training data too closely.
4) Data Augmentation
    - In the context of image, text, or audio data, augmenting the dataset can help increase its diversity, leading to better generalization.

### How KNN differs from k-means clustering?
- [KNN](supervised_algorithm/KNN.ipynb) is supervised learning where [k-means clustering](unsupervised_algorithm/k_means_clustering.ipynb) is unsupervised learning
- if we give a test value to knn, it get distance with all train values then sorts it. Then it takes k nearest values and get the most frequent value from them.
- on the other hand, k-means clustering get the distance of trained k-centroids with the test data and choses the nearest centroid to assign the test data to that cluster.
- The critical difference here is that KNN needs labeled points and is thus supervised learning, while k-means doesn’t—and is thus unsupervised learning.

### Explain how a ROC curve works.
- ROC curve is a graphical representation of the trade-off between the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) for a binary classification system as its discrimination threshold is varied. It is also called trade-off between the sensitivity of the model (true positives) vs the fall-out or the probability it will trigger a false alarm (false positives).

### Define precision and recall.
- Precision and recall are two fundamental metrics for evaluating the performance of classification models. They are defined as follows:
    - Precision: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations. It is also called Positive Predictive Value (PPV).
        - TP / (TP + FP)
    - Recall: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the all observations in actual class. It is also called True Positive Rate or Sensitivity.
        - TP / (TP + FN)
    - Precision and recall are inversely related. As precision increases, recall falls and vice-versa. This is called the precision-recall trade-off.

### What is Naive Bayes’ Theorem?
- Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm for binary (two-class) and multi-class classification problems. It is based on Bayes’ theorem with the assumption of independence between every pair of features. Naive Bayes is a simple and effective algorithm for classification tasks.

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

### What is ensemble learning technique?
- Ensemble learning is a machine learning paradigm where multiple models (often called “weak learners”) are trained to solve the same problem and combined to get better results. The main hypothesis is that when weak models are correctly combined, they can outperform a single powerful model.

    - **Bagging**: Training multiple individual models in a parallel way. Each model is trained by a random subset of the data.
    - **Boosting**: Training multiple individual models in a sequential way. Each individual model learns from the mistakes of the previous model.
    - **Stacking**: Training multiple individual models and combine them by training a meta-model to output predictions based on the multiple models’ predictions.

    - **Random Forest**: Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.
    - **Gradient Boosting**: Gradient Boosting is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees.

### What’s the “kernel trick” and how is it useful?
- The kernel trick is a method of using a linear classifier to solve a non-linear problem. It transforms the linearly inseparable data into linearly separable data by adding a new dimension to the feature space. This new dimension is called the kernel trick. The kernel trick is useful because it allows us to use linear classifiers to solve non-linear problems.
the formula for the kernel trick is:
    - K(x, y) = (x . y + 1)^d
    - where d is the degree of the polynomial kernel.
name of some kernels:
    - Linear Kernel -> K(x, y) = x . y
    - Polynomial Kernel -> K(x, y) = (x . y + 1)^d
    - Gaussian Kernel -> K(x, y) = exp(-||x - y||^2 / 2 * sigma^2)
    - Sigmoid Kernel -> K(x, y) = tanh(x . y + r)

### Different cost funtions use in different algorithms
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 
    - 1/n * Σ(yi - ŷi)^2
    - Linear Regression
- **Log Loss or Binary Cross-Entropy Loss**:
    - -1/n * Σ(yi * log(ŷi) + (1 - yi) * log(1 - ŷi))
    - Logistic Regression
- **Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss**:
    - -1/n * ΣΣ(yij * log(ŷij))
    - Multiclass Classification
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**:
    - 1/n * Σ|yi - ŷi|
    - Regression
- **Hinge Loss**:
    - 1/n * Σmax(0, 1 - yi * ŷi)
    - Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### Different Types of Optimization Algorithms and Their Use

Let:
- $\theta$ = parameters (or weights) of the model
- $\eta$ = learning rate (controls the step size in updating parameters)
- $J(\theta)$ = cost function (objective function we want to minimize)
- $\nabla_{\theta} J(\theta)$ = gradient of the cost function with respect to parameters (direction to adjust $\theta$ `to reduce` $J(\theta)$)

- **Gradient Descent (GD)**
    - **Equation:**  
      $\theta = \theta - \alpha \nabla J(\theta)$
    - **Description:**  
      Updates parameters ($\theta$) by moving them in the direction of the negative gradient of the cost function $J(\theta)$ with respect to $\theta$, scaled by the learning rate ($\alpha$).
    - **How Cost Function Helps:**  
      The cost function $J(\theta)$ provides a measure of error or loss, which gradient descent minimizes by iteratively adjusting $\theta$ in the opposite direction of the gradient. Lowering the cost function value improves model performance.

- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**
    - **Equation:**  
      $\theta = \theta - \alpha \nabla J(\theta; x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$
    - **Description:**  
      Similar to gradient descent, but updates parameters for each individual training example $(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$ rather than the entire dataset, making it more computationally efficient.
    - **How Cost Function Helps:**  
      The cost function guides each step, as minimizing it iteratively on small data samples ensures faster convergence and helps avoid getting stuck in local minima.

- **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent**
    - **Equation:**  
      $\theta = \theta - \alpha \nabla J(\theta; B)$
    - **Description:**  
      A compromise between GD and SGD, updating parameters based on a small "mini-batch" of data $B$, instead of the entire dataset or a single instance.
    - **How Cost Function Helps:**  
      Using mini-batches provides a more accurate gradient estimate, allowing a smoother and faster convergence towards the cost function's minimum.

- **Momentum**
    - **Equation:**  
      $v = \beta v + \nabla J(\theta)$  
      $\theta = \theta - \alpha v$
    - **Description:**  
      Adds a "momentum" term to the parameter update, where $\beta$ controls the contribution of previous gradients, helping to speed up convergence.
    - **How Cost Function Helps:**  
      The cost function’s gradient is used to accumulate momentum in the update, smoothing out noisy gradients and enabling faster movement towards the optimum.

- **Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)**
    - **Equation:**  
      $m_t = \beta_1 m_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_1) \nabla J(\theta)$  
      $v_t = \beta_2 v_{t-1} + (1 - \beta_2) (\nabla J(\theta))^2$  
      $\theta = \theta - \alpha \frac{m_t}{\sqrt{v_t} + \epsilon}$
    - **Description:**  
      Combines momentum and adaptive learning rate, using first ($m_t$) and second moment ($v_t$) estimates of gradients to adjust the learning rate for each parameter adaptively.
    - **How Cost Function Helps:**  
      The cost function's gradient influences both moment estimates, guiding the optimization with adaptive updates to achieve faster convergence and reduce oscillations near the minimum.

- **RMSProp (Root Mean Square Propagation)**
    - **Equation:**  
      $E[g^2]_t = \beta E[g^2]_{t-1} + (1 - \beta)(\nabla J(\theta))^2$  
      $\theta = \theta - \alpha \frac{\nabla J(\theta)}{\sqrt{E[g^2]_t + \epsilon}}$
    - **Description:**  
      Adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on the average of squared gradients, helping to avoid large updates and stabilize training.
    - **How Cost Function Helps:**  
      The cost function gradient is squared and averaged to dynamically adjust the learning rate, stabilizing updates and preventing divergence in deep networks.

Each algorithm's update rule moves $ \theta $ in the direction that minimizes the cost function, with different strategies for adapting the learning rate and gradient usage based on dataset size and task complexity.

### Different types of activation functions and use
1. **Sigmoid**
    - **Formula**: $ \sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}} $
    - **Use**: Often used in the output layer for binary classification models to produce probabilities between 0 and 1.

2. **Softmax**
    - **Formula**: $ \text{softmax}(x_i) = \frac{e^{x_i}}{\sum_j e^{x_j}} $
    - **Use**: Typically used in the output layer for multiclass classification models. It converts logits into probabilities for each class.

3. **Tanh (Hyperbolic Tangent)**
    - **Formula**: $ \text{tanh}(x) = 2\sigma(2x) - 1 = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}} $
    - **Use**: Commonly used in hidden layers of neural networks. Produces outputs between -1 and 1, which helps with symmetry around zero.

4. **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**
    - **Formula**: $ \text{ReLU}(x) = \max(0, x) $
    - **Use**: Widely used in hidden layers, especially in deep networks, because it helps prevent the "vanishing gradient" problem.

5. **Leaky ReLU**
    - **Formula**: $ \text{LeakyReLU}(x) = \max(\alpha x, x) $ (where $ \alpha $ is a small constant, often 0.01)
    - **Use**: Used in hidden layers to address the problem of "dying ReLUs" by allowing a small gradient when $ x < 0 $.

6. **Swish**
    - **Formula**: $ \text{Swish}(x) = x \cdot \sigma(x) $
    - **Use**: Often used in hidden layers for a smoother alternative to ReLU, shown to work well in some deep learning models.

7. **GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit)**
    - **Formula**: $ \text{GELU}(x) = 0.5x(1 + \text{tanh}(\sqrt{2/\pi} (x + 0.044715x^3))) $
    - **Use**: Used in hidden layers, particularly in transformer architectures like BERT, to give a smoother, probabilistic alternative to ReLU.



### Calculating matrix output shape in CNN
- The formula to calculate the output shape of a convolutional layer is given by:
    - `O = (N - K + 2P) / S + 1`
    - where O is the output height/length, N is the input height/length, K is the Kernel size, P is the padding, and S is the stride.
    - The output shape of a convolutional layer is determined by the input shape, kernel size, padding, and stride.

- **Example**: 
    - Input shape: 32x32x3
    - Filter size: 5x5
    - Padding: 2
    - Stride: 1
    - Output shape: (32 - 5 + 2*2) / 1 + 1 = 32
    - The output shape of the convolutional layer is 32x32x3.

### Steps in a machine learning pipeline
1) **Data Collection**: Collecting data from various sources like databases, APIs, or web scraping.
2) **Data Preprocessing**: This stage involves cleaning, transforming and preparing input data for modeling. Common preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
3) **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features from existing features or transforming features.
4) **Model Selection**: Choosing the appropriate machine learning model based on the problem type (classification, regression, clustering, etc.) and the data characteristics.
5) **Model Training**: Training the selected model on the training data.
6) **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance on the test data using appropriate evaluation metrics.
7) **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Tuning the model's hyperparameters to improve performance.



### RLHF explanation
- RLHF stands for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. It is a machine learning paradigm that combines reinforcement learning with human feedback to improve the learning process. In RLHF, the agent learns from both the environment and human feedback to make harmless and helpful decision. This approach is particularly useful in scenarios where the environment is complex or the reward signal is sparse. By incorporating human feedback, RLHF can accelerate the learning process and improve the agent's performance.
    - **Types of Human Feedback**:
        - **Reward Shaping**: Providing additional rewards to guide the agent towards the desired behavior.
        - **Demonstrations**: Showing the agent examples of correct behavior to learn from.
        - **Preferences**: Indicating preferences or rankings to guide the agent's decision-making.

### Adversarial Attacks in Machine Learning
- Adversarial attacks are a type of attack on machine learning models that involve making small, imperceptible changes to input data to cause the model to make incorrect predictions revealing vulnerabilities and sensitive data of the model. 
    - **Misclassification Attacks**: Modifying input data to cause the model to misclassify it.
    - **Evasion Attacks**: Modifying input data to evade detection or classification by the model.
    - **Poisoning Attacks**: Injecting malicious data into the training set to manipulate the model's behavior.
    - **Model Inversion Attacks**: Reverse-engineering the model to extract sensitive information from it.
    - **Membership Inference Attacks**: Determining whether a specific data point was used in the training set of the model.
